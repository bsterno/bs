# Personal Portfolio

My site

## Getting Started

Not sure why you would want to run my personal website locally on your machine... but if you're so inclined, follow the rest of this readme.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

1. Install the latest version of [Yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn), follow the installation guide in the link provided.


### Installing

1. cd into the root directory

```
yarn install
```

2. Run the site locally

```
yarn start
```

You can now access the site via localhost


## Deployment

My site is deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), however there are various other options such as:
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

## Built With

* [React Static](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static) - The web framework used
